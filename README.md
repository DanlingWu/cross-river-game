# Cross River Raft Game

A farmer needs to cross the river but he can only take one thing with him on his raft.

If he leaves the fox and goose alone on the river bank, the fox will eat the goose.

If he leaves the goose and beans alone, the goose will eat the beans.

This was built following a model-view-controller design pattern in Java.
